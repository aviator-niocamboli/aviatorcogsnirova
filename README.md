## Aviator Game Guide

### Gameplay Mechanics

In Aviator, players place bets before a plane takes off. As the plane
flies, the multiplier will increase. Players can choose to cash out
their winnings at any time by clicking the "Cash Out" button.
However, if the plane crashes before they cash out, they will lose their
bet.

### Strategies

-   **Play with minimal risk:** Bet a small amount and cash out when the
    multiplier reaches a low value (e.g., 1.2-2).
-   **Aim for high multipliers:** Wait for the plane to fly for a longer
    period before cashing out, as this will increase the potential
    multiplier.
-   **Use the auto-cashout feature:** Set the desired multiplier at
    which you want to cash out automatically, ensuring you don\'t miss
    out on winnings due to slow reaction time.
